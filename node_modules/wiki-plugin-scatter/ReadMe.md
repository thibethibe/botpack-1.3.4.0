# Federated Wiki - Scatter Plugin

The Scatter plugin finds and renders multi-faceted datasets as a scatter diagram.

The Scatter plugin listens for 'thumb' events and choose the selected column as the horizontal displacement for the diagram.

See a [video](http://video.fed.wiki.org/16-ward-wiki-nmsi.html) of the Scatter Plugin in use.
